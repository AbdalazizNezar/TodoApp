    <p>Hello! Thank you for using TodoApp! This app was created by Abdul, or AbdulTheDev#9311! This app is still getting updated frequently, so make sure to check my server and the repo for updates! This app is available on browser and as a windows app.</p>
    <p>To get started, add tasks using the + icon in the Todo Page! If you would like to mark the task as done, simply click the task, and do the opposite for marking the task as undone if it was marked as done. You could also delete a task when you finished it, simply by marking it as done then clicking the bin icon on the right!</p>
